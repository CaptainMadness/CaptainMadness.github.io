    <h3>Meals</h3>
    <p>What makes some food healthier than others isn't as challenging as it may seem. A good rule to follow is ensuring that the food you consume provides the necessary nutrients. This, of course, means choosing whole foods. Processed foods often contain excessive empty calories.   </p>
    <h3>Protein</h3>
    <p>Protein serves as the foundation for muscle growth and strength. Consuming a healthy amount of protein is crucial. If you aim to lose weight, ensure that your meals contain an adequate protein content. Examples of protein-rich foods include steak, chicken, and fish.
. </p>
    <h3>vegetables and fruit</h3>
    <p>Vegetables are an important source of many micronutrients; therefore, it is crucial to incorporate them into your meals. Fruits are also a good source of micronutrients but are usually high in fiber, making it a good idea to include them to aid digestion. Additionally, consider replacing your snacks with a fruit or vegetable for a healthier option. </p>

    <h4>Little tip</h4>
    <p>Many people may advise staying away from fats and carbs, but it is important to consume them as your body does, in fact, need these nutrients. We recommend using olive oil whenever possible, as it is the healthiest fat to use and, in fact, has some benefits.s </p>
